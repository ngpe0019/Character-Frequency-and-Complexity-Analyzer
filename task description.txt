Project 2: Character Frequency and Complexity Analyzer

Goal: Measure how “complex” a writing sample is.

Concepts Used:
Dictionaries, string operations, loops, conditionals, sorting tuples.

Task:

Read a .txt file.

Compute:

Frequency of each character (ignore case).

Average word length.

Most frequent 10 letters.

Compute a complexity score = (average word length × number of unique words) ÷ 100

Output all metrics in a readable format.

Example Output:
Average word length: 5.3
Unique words: 870
Top 10 letters: e, t, a, o, n, s, i, r, h, l
Complexity score: 46.11
