Photosynthesis is the process by which green plants and some other organisms use sunlight to synthesize foods from carbon dioxide and water. It involves the green pigment chlorophyll and generates oxygen as a byproduct. Photosynthesis provides the primary energy source for nearly all ecosystems. Through this process, plants convert solar energy into chemical energy, storing it in the bonds of glucose molecules. The efficiency of photosynthesis can be affected by environmental factors such as light intensity, carbon dioxide concentration, temperature, and water availability. Understanding photosynthesis is crucial for agriculture, environmental science, and efforts to combat climate change. Innovations in artificial photosynthesis are being explored to produce sustainable energy solutions.
